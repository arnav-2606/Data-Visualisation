# Data-Visualisation
The goal of this project is to develop an interactive platform to visualise and explore the data of international football matches played between 1872 and 2022. Users will be able to explore the evolution of international football through detailed data and statistics on match results, goals scored, team performance, and player performance on the platform. To achieve this goal, we will collect and analyse data from various sources, including official football associations, media outlets, and online databases. To present the data in an understandable and engaging format, we will use data visualisation techniques such as charts, graphs, and maps. Users will be able to filter the data by teams, players, tournaments, and time periods using the platform. Users will also be able to compare and track the performance of various teams and players over time. Furthermore, the platform will provide insights into historical trends and patterns in international football, such as team dominance, the impact of rule changes, and the evolution of playing styles. 
Overall, this project will provide an educational and interactive platform for football fans, researchers, and enthusiasts to learn about the rich history of international football and gain insights into its evolution.
